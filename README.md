===================

[Follow This Tutorial To Reproduce This Repo](https://dev.to/cia_rana/quick-tutorial-write-go-run-wasm-2ilf)

I added in a few scripts to script the instructnions in the tutorial

```
# Get the latest Go version that has WASM support
./setup

# Build WASM code

# Execute the WASM code.
./build && ./run
```
  
- You will see a run button at http://localhost:8080
- Open the developer tab and see a message written to the Javascript console
